CSE574 - Introduction to Machine Learning
(University at Buffalo)

Technologies used: MATLAB

Project 1 - Probability and Bayesian Networks
— Understand the basic functionality of MATLAB
— Understand the basic concepts of probability such as mean, variance, correlation, likelihood and Bayesian Networks


Project 2 - Learning to Rank using Linear Regression
— Implemented a ranking algorithm on a real world, Microsoft LETOR 4.0, dataset consisting of 70000 webpages with 46 features each.
— Trained and tuned the model hyper parameters to rank webpages


Project 3 - Handwritten Digit Recognition using Classification Algorithms
—  Implemented and evaluated the performance of classification models such as Logistic Regression, Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks
— The final model can recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy
