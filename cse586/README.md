(University at Buffalo)

Technologies Used - Android, SQLite, Java

Project 1 - Simple Messenger App on Android
-- A Simple Messaging app to send messages between two Android emulator instances.

Project 2A - Group Messenger App on Android
-- A Group Messaging app to send messages between 5 Android emulator instances

Project 2B - Group Messenger App with Total and FIFO Ordering
-- Implemented a modified version of ISIS algorithm to allow simultaneous multicasting of messages to multiple instances and guarantee Total and FIFO ordering
-- Implemented failure handling to ensure ordering guarantees even during failure of an instance

Project 3 - Simple Distributed Hash Table
-- Designed a Chord based distributed hash table which can handle new Node Joins
-- The app can insert, query and delete key-value pairs using ring based routing

Project 4 - Amazon Dynamo based Replicated Key-Value Storage in Android
-- Implemented a replicated key-value storage which provides availability and linearizability using chain replication
-- Handled concurrent reads and writes along with dynamic node joins, failure and recovery
